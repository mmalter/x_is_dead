## x_is_dead

Check wether a JS framework is dead

# Rationale

A friend told me that JQuery was dead and I really wasn't believing that. AÂ conversation about the meaning of death ensued. Let's cut the bullshit. Let's crunch statistics.

# Last but not least

The name of this package does not imply that X is dead and we should all start using Wayland. By no means.
